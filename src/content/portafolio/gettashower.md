Gettashower is a logistical solution designed to solve the "hygiene gap" in hyper-mobile urban environments. In warm, high-density cities like Madrid, Barcelona, or Buenos Aires, travelers and active professionals often find themselves "stuck" between activities—after a gym session, a long flight, or a day at the beach—without a private place to freshen up. This platform transforms the city into a distributed wellness network by partnering with existing infrastructure—such as boutique gyms, coworking spaces, and hostels—to monetize their underutilized shower facilities. Instead of paying for an expensive hotel day-rate or carrying a heavy bag all day, users can use a seamless mobile interface to find, book, and access a high-quality "Refresh Point" and locker in minutes.

Technically, the project is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to ensure a zero-friction "instant-access" experience without requiring an app store download. The backend leverages Supabase for real-time database management and secure user authentication, while Stripe Connect handles the complex task of automated payment splits between the platform and local partners. To ensure scalability and security, the system utilizes Dynamic QR Codes for access control and integrates Mapbox API for real-time geolocation and "amenity-filtering" (searching for specific needs like hairdryers or towel service). By applying AI-driven dynamic pricing, the platform optimizes rates based on local demand and weather conditions, creating a high-margin, asset-light business model that treats "hygiene-on-demand" as a scalable utility for the modern nomad.
