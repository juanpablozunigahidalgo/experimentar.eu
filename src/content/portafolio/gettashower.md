Gettashower is a logistical solution designed to solve the “hygiene gap” in hyper-mobile urban environments. In warm, high-density cities like Madrid, Barcelona, or Buenos Aires, travelers and active professionals often find themselves “stuck” between activities—after a gym session, a long flight, or a commute—without a private place to freshen up. This platform transforms the city into a distributed wellness network by partnering with existing infrastructure—such as boutique gyms, coworking spaces, and hotels—to monetize their underutilized shower facilities. Instead of paying for an expensive hotel day-rate or carrying a heavy bag all day, users can use a seamless mobile interface to find, access, and pay for a high-quality “Refresh Point” in minutes.

Technically, the project is built as a high-performance native mobile application using Flutter Dart to ensure rapid deployment and direct hardware integration for QR scanning and GPS. The backend leverages Supabase for robust PostgreSQL database management, utilizing a scalable "three-tier architecture" that strictly separates user profiles from corporate fiscal entities. Stripe Connect handles the complex task of automated payment splits between the platform and local partners. To ensure transparency and speed, the system utilizes Supabase Realtime to power a “live-meter” session model triggered by QR Codes: the app tracks duration and cost instantly upon scanning. Integrated Google Maps services provide real-time geolocation and “amenity-filtering,” creating a high-margin, asset-light business model that treats “hygiene-on-demand” as a scalable utility for the modern nomad.
