This project was developed as a technical requirement for SunPower Corporation, a leading renewable energy company in the United States. It consists of a specialized backend API designed for carbon accounting and solar compensation modeling. The system allows corporate customers to quantify their operational CO2 emissions and calculate the offsetting impact of renewable energy generated by solar projects.

The application is built using Python 3.11 and FastAPI, leveraging SQLAlchemy as the ORM to manage complex data models. The logic implements standardized formulas to convert raw activity data—such as fuel consumption and electricity use—into gross emissions. Furthermore, it models a solar compensation scheme that calculates avoided emissions based on regional grid factors and capacity metrics, providing companies with a precise net emissions balance.

The codebase adheres to high engineering standards, featuring a fully containerized environment with Docker and comprehensive integration tests using pytest. It includes a health-check system and automated Swagger documentation for seamless API exploration. This project demonstrates a strong command of data modeling, serverless-ready architecture, and the ability to translate environmental compliance rules into efficient backend logic.
